## Files:
There are 7files in the directory:

file run_analysis.R contains the scipt for all 5 part of the assignmet

file names_new.csv containes the descriptive names for all the features with mean() or std() in their original names

file readMe.md  this file

file CodeBook.md a detailed description and walkthrough through the scripts. It also includes a description of the main variables

the output files activity_means.csv, subject_means.csv and activity-subject_means.csv.The content of these files is described in CodeBook.md


## General assumptions
Assumption is that data have been downloaded already into directory:
C:/Users/Christian/datasciencecoursera/Assignmentf

The assignment does not state that the download need to be included in the script and that a generic directory is used.
After download the data are uploaded into R . First only the data required for part one of the assignment are read. Other data is read later on.
